All Star Wars background pictures, music, and logos are registered trademarks and copyright of LucasArts and Disney. We do not recieve original credit for those trademarks and copyrights in anyway, shape, or form.



Modified Webpage:

I modified the webpage to add backgrounds, music(at main page), extra links, Server Online/Offline Status at Main Page (currently cant find correct port number for $portg but Login Server Status is working. If you accidently delete the port number for the Login Status, it is 10666. just put that in $portl if needed. If someone happens to find the correct port with no errors or crashes, please let us know with the correct port number).

Currently I have no mysql database and oracle database experience to configure and modify the database for the Number of Players Online status so please let me know if you got this configured and how and what you did.

Make sure to change the IP addresses in webpage code (not counting 127.0.0.1 in Server Status), to current IP address of VM in lower left corner of VM screen. Bring up a web browser and type in the address bar: http://(your.VM.Address.here) without the (). Then you can refresh the page when you change any of the webpage code.
